# CP4BA - Oneshot GitOps Install


## Acknowledgements

This project was chiefly inspired off the good work done by the Apollo, GitOps and OTP teams as given below:

1) https://github.com/apollo-business-automation/ibm-cp4ba-enterprise-deployment 
2) https://github.com/one-touch-provisioning/otp-gitops
3) https://production-gitops.dev/ 


## Overview

Deploying CloudPaks into supported clouds in a repetable, automatable fashion is a non trivial, potentially time consuming process. This project aims to lay the foundation for future deployments, culminating in an end state which supports the following capabilities:

1) Ability to select CloudPaks, and which services within said CloudPak to deploy
2) Ability to deploy common, "big win" use cases (applications) using said framework
3) Native integration with a wide range of CI Tooling. Eg, Jenkins.
4) A range of target deployments options given, ranging from all major hyperscalers to on-premise deployments
5) Inbuilt monitoring and auditing framework to support day 2 operations 
6) And more

This is still a work in progress, we expect more work to be done here down the road.

## Shoutouts

Many thanks to the both of you.
